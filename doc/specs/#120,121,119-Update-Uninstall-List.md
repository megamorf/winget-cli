# Windows Package Manager Upgrade, Uninstall and List Command Spec

State: `DRAFT`

## Abstract

For our preview of the Windows Package Manager, the goal was to enable install of apps. In order to be a package manager, the Windows Package Manager must be able to list all installed packages, communicate if there is an update and uninstall apps.  

This spec will cover the following commands: `list`, `update`, and `uninstall`.

## Inspiration

See abstract. :)

## Solution Design

* List
* Update / Upgrade
* Uninstall

### List

The `list` command is a very specific search that will show the applications currently installed. `list` will also compare the installed version to the known repository version. If there is an update available, this will be provided as well.

#### Usage

`winget list [[-q] <query>] [<options>]`

![list command](Images/120-List.png)

`list` when executed by itself will show all apps installed by the Windows Package Manager.

#### Arguments

The following arguments are available.

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `-q`, `--query` | The query used to search for an application. |
| `-?`, `--help` | Gets additional help on this command. |

#### Options

The following options are available.

| Option | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `--all` | Show all applications that are installed, including apps not installed through Windows Package Manager|
| `--id` | Filter results by ID. |
| `--name` | Filter results by name. |
| `--moniker` | Filter results by application moniker. |
| `--tag` | Filter results by tag
| `--command` | Filter results by command
| `-s`, `--source` | Find the application using the specified [source](source.md). |
| `-e`, `--exact` | Find the application using exact match. |

By default `list` will show those apps installed through the Windows Package Manager. However developers should be able to view all apps currently installed via other means.  

`--all` will allow the Windows Package Manager to provide `list` data on all apps whether installed through the Package Manager or not.

To obtain this data, the Windows Package Manager will query the **Apps and Features** installed apps. This appears to be a superset of **Add Remove Programs** (ARP).

#### Installed with Windows Package Manager

If the app is installed with the Windows Package Manager, we have the ID to map the installed version to the repository version. If the version installed on the PC is lower than the the version in the repository, the list command will show the available version in the "available update."

#### Installed out of band from the Windows Package Manager but in repo

If the app is installed out of band from the Package Manager, the app will be discovered if it registers correctly with the **Apps and Features**. The Windows Package Manager will map the installed app back to the repo. If the version installed is less than the version available in the repo, the `list` command will show the available version in the "available update."

If the installed version is greater than or equal to the version of the app available in the repo, then the "available update" will be left blank.

#### Installed out of band from the Windows Package Manager but not in repo

If the app is installed out of band from the Package Manager, and is not available in the repo, then the Windows Package Manager will treat it as if there are no updates available.

#### Mapping between Windows Package Manager repo and Apps and Features

> Open Issue: A significant issue is going to be mapping apps not initially installed by the package manager. Here is my back of the napkin proposal.

**StoreApps**  
Store apps will be mapped via the The Package Family Name (which is composed by Publisher and Name). The Package Family Name will be consistent between Apps and Features and the Windows Package Manager repo

**MSIs and EXEs**  
Will be mapped to the Windows Package Manager repo via the SystemAppId. The SystemAppId is a required field. The value in the field differs depending on the InstallerType.

For MSI it is the product code - typically a GUID that is found in the uninstall registry location and includes the brackets like `{5740BD44-B58D-321A-AFC0-6D3D4556DD6C}`, e.g.:

```plaintext
64bit application example:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\{3740BD44-B58D-321A-AFC0-6D3D4556DD6C}

32bit application example:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\{3740BD44-B58D-321A-AFC0-6D3D4556DD6C}
```

For inno, wix, nullsoft, and exe, the SystemAppId should be a string that is located in either of the Uninstall keys above.

**Zip files**  
We expect to add Zip Support. As such, ZIP does mot have a unique identifier. The Windows Package Manager will need to track where the files were installed, so that it can remove the file and preserve the users files.

### Upgrade

The `upgrade` command is designed to update one or more applications. When executed with no parameters or with `--all` it will update all packages that have updates available.

#### Usage

`winget upgrade [[-q] <query>] [<options>]`

![upgrade command](https://via.placeholder.com/800x300?text=winget+upgrade+example+image)

`upgrade` when executed by itself will upgrade all apps ready for updates by the Windows Package Manager.

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `-q`,`--query` | The query used to search for an application. |
| `-?`,`--help` | Gets additional help on this command. |

#### Options

The following options are available.

| Option | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `--all` | Update all applications that are installed and have updates available. |
| `--id` | Filter results by ID. |
| `--name` | Filter results by name. |
| `--moniker` | Filter results by application moniker. |
| `--tag` | Filter results by tag. |
| `--command` | Filter results by command. |
| `-s`, `--source` | Find the application using the specified [source](source.md). |
| `-e`, `--exact` | Find the application using exact match. |

#### Upgrade app when no update is available

If the user attempts to update an app that there is no known update for, the package manager will issue an error:
*There is no update available from the community repository. If you need to reinstall or repair the app, try `winget repair <appname>`.*

#### Dependencies

Handling dependencies will be a challenge once Windows Package Manager supports dependencies. Dependencies are not covered as part of this spec.

> Open Issue: if the application is not side by side, it will force an uninstall of the previous version to upgrade. We will need to assume the installer will handle this case.

### Uninstall

The `uninstall` command is designed to uninstall an application.

#### Usage

`winget uninstall [[-q] <query>] [<options>]`

![uninstall command](https://via.placeholder.com/800x300?text=winget+uninstall+example+image)

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `-q`, `--query` | The query used to search for an application. |
| `-?`, `--help` | Gets additional help on this command. |

#### Options

The following options are available.

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--id` | Filter results by ID. |
| `--name` | Filter results by name. |
| `--moniker` | Filter results by application moniker. |
| `--tag` | Filter results by tag. |
| `--command` | Filter results by command. |
| `-s`, `--source` | Find the application using the specified [source](source.md). |
| `-e`, `--exact` | Find the application using exact match. |

#### Error Cases**

If the application does not include a `SystemAppId` then the uninstall will not be available.
